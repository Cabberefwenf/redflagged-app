# RedFlagged 🚩

**RedFlagged** is a mobile-first, anonymous behavioral report platform designed for men to share dating experiences backed by images, context, and safety indicators — all while maintaining strict ethical, legal, and moderation standards.

---

## ✅ Core Purpose

- Help men identify *patterns* of behavior that could affect their safety, time, or finances
- Enable *visual, structured, and anonymous* reporting of real-world dating interactions
- Create a reference system for community-driven behavioral awareness (not judgment)

- No doxxing, revenge, nudity, or graphic sexual content
- No full real names (unless tied to a public handle)
